This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

# Introduction
Welcome to `CheckR:` A User-Friendly Collection Validation Script for Depositors and Users. This tool is designed to function as a sanity check for depositors and users of digital language collections. We have included comments (noted by a "#" symbol in front of the associated comment line) to help you understand the function of each part of the code, as well as be able to edit the lines of code in very simple ways to choose what functions' outputs you do or do not want to see in a given run of the code.

## Setup
First, set the `fileroot` - that's the folder that you want to analyze. This chunk also sets some R options.  Your "fileroot" will be your file path to your collection folder. In this example, it is `/Users/ireneyi/Downloads/toyfiles` because the example collection I am using, a folder called "toyfiles", is located in my computer's downloads folder. You will replace the part within the quotes " " with your own file path. Note that if you are using a Windows computer, you'll need to use something like `c:\\users\ireneyi\Downloads`.


```{r setup}
fileroot = c("/Users/xxx/path.to.files")

local({r <- getOption("repos")
       r["CRAN"] <- "http://cran.r-project.org"
       options(repos=r)})
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = fileroot)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


**The first time you use this code, RUN this section of the code before doing anything else; this will ensure that you have all the packages you need to run the rest of the code.** To run it, change `eval=FALSE` to read `eval=TRUE`. You only need to install the packages once.


```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("plyr")
install.packages("magrittr") # package installations are only needed the first time you use it
install.packages("dplyr")    # alternative installation of the %>%
install.packages("reticulate")
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dalejbarr/elan", force = TRUE)
install.packages("tools")
install.packages("xfun")
install.packages("yaml")
```

This chunk loads the packages you'll need.

```{r message=FALSE}
#if packages are already installed, you can just run this chunk before you run the following parts of the code
library(plyr)
library(magrittr) # needs to be run every time you start R and want to use %>%
library(dplyr) 
library(reticulate)
library(devtools)
library(tools)
library(xfun)
library(yaml) #for writing to text files
```

# Read in directory and list files

This block of code reads in your collection and gets a list of all of your files, as well as the directories/file paths (for purposes of reading files into code, or for locating where in subfolders files exist).

```{r}

files = list.files(path = fileroot, pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE,
           full.names = FALSE, recursive = TRUE,
           ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = FALSE, no.. = FALSE)

#If you want to see ALL of your files listed out, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
#files

directories = list.dirs(fileroot, recursive = TRUE, full.names = FALSE)
directories
```

## Counting files

This next block of code counts the total number of files within your collection, lists every single type of file extension present in your collection, and counts the number of files that have each type of file extension.

```{r}
file_exts <- c()
for (val in files) {
  ext <- file_ext(toString(val))
  file_exts <- append(file_exts, ext)
}
df <- data.frame(file_exts)

tot_num_files <- length(file_exts)
sprintf("You have %d total files in your entire collection.", tot_num_files)

print("Here is a table with every type of file extension that exists in your collection, along with how many files have each extensions (for example, if it says '226' under 'pfs', it means you have 226 files with the .pfs extension):")
tab_with_group <- table(df$file_exts) 
tab_with_group
```


# Elan files
This next part of the script will count (and optionally list out) all the .eaf (Elan) files in your collection.

```{r}
fnames_eaf <- list.files(fileroot, pattern = "\\.eaf$", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)

x1 <- length(fnames_eaf)
sprintf("You have %d total .eaf files.", x1)

#If you want to see ALL of your eaf files listed out, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
fnames_eaf
```

## Missing audio files

The next block of code checks to see how many .eaf files are missing corresponding audio files (in the form of .wav or .mp4).

```{r}
#check eaf files to see if they have matching audio files
missing_audio <- c()
with_audio <- c()
for (j in fnames_eaf) {
  subDir <- j
  semi_subDir <- sans_ext(subDir)
  lowercase_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".wav")
  uppercase_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".WAV")
  mp4_lower_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".mp4")
  mp4_upper_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".MP4")
  
  if (file.exists(lowercase_subDir) || file.exists(uppercase_subDir) || file.exists(mp4_lower_subDir) || file.exists(mp4_upper_subDir)){
      with_audio <- append(with_audio, subDir)
  } else {
      missing_audio <- append(missing_audio, subDir)
  }
}

num_missing_audio <- length(missing_audio)
sprintf("You have %d .eaf files in your collection that are missing corresponding audio files.", num_missing_audio)

#If you want to see the names of ALL of your eaf files that are MISSING audio files, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
missing_audio


num_with_audio <- length(with_audio)
sprintf("You have %d .eaf files in your collection that have corresponding audio files.", num_with_audio)


#If you want to see the names of ALL of your eaf files that HAVE audio files, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
with_audio
```

## Settings files
The next block of code checks to see how many .eaf files are missing corresponding settings files (either in .pfs or .pfsx file formats). Note that these files are mostly cosmetic, but they di include audio/transcript offset information. If that's not archived, the link between transcripts and any offset is lost (meaning the transcripts no longer align with the audio).

```{r}
#check eaf files to see if they have matching settings files
missing_settings <- c()
with_settings <- c()
for (j in fnames_eaf) {
  subDir <- j
  semi_subDir <- sans_ext(subDir)
  lowercase_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".pfs")
  uppercase_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".PFS")
  pfsx_lower_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".pfsx")
  pfsx_upper_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".PFSX")
  
  if (file.exists(lowercase_subDir) || file.exists(uppercase_subDir) || file.exists(pfsx_lower_subDir) || file.exists(pfsx_upper_subDir)){
      with_settings <- append(with_settings, subDir)
  } else {
      missing_settings <- append(missing_settings, subDir)
  }
}

num_missing_settings <- length(missing_settings)
sprintf("You have %d .eaf files in your collection that are missing corresponding settings files.", num_missing_settings)


#If you want to see the names of ALL of your eaf files that are MISSING settings files, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
missing_settings

num_with_settings <- length(with_settings)
sprintf("You have %d .eaf files in your collection that have corresponding settings files.", num_with_settings)

#If you want to see the names of ALL of your eaf files that HAVE settings files, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
with_settings
```

## Missing transcripts

The next block of code checks to see how many .eaf files are missing corresponding transcript (.txt) files.

```{r}
#check eaf files to see if they have matching transcript (.txt) files
missing_txt <- c()
with_txt <- c()
for (j in fnames_eaf) {
  subDir <- j
  semi_subDir <- sans_ext(subDir)
  lowercase_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".txt")
  uppercase_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".TXT")
  
  if (file.exists(lowercase_subDir) || file.exists(uppercase_subDir)){
      with_txt <- append(with_txt, subDir)
  } else {
      missing_txt <- append(missing_txt, subDir)
  }
}

num_missing_txt <- length(missing_txt)
sprintf("You have %d .eaf files in your collection that are missing corresponding transcript (.txt) files.", num_missing_txt)

#If you want to see the names of ALL of your eaf files that are MISSING transcript (.txt) files, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
missing_txt

num_with_txt <- length(with_txt)
sprintf("You have %d .eaf files in your collection that have corresponding transcript (.txt) files.", num_with_txt)


#If you want to see the names of ALL of your eaf files that HAVE transcript (.txt) files, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
with_txt
```

# Audio files

This next part of the script will count (and optionally list out) all the audio files in your collection. 

```{r}
fnames_audio <- list.files(fileroot, pattern = "\\.wav$|\\.mp4$", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE, ignore.case = TRUE)

x2 <- length(fnames_audio)
sprintf("You have %d total audio files.", x2)

#If you want to see ALL of your eaf files listed out, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
fnames_audio
```

## Missing audio files
The next block of code checks to see how many audio files are missing .eaf/ELAN files (in .eaf format).

```{r}
#check audio files to see if they have matching eaf files
missing_eaf <- c()
with_eaf <- c()
for (j in fnames_audio) {
  subDir <- j
  semi_subDir <- sans_ext(subDir)
  lowercase_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".eaf")
  uppercase_subDir <- with_ext(semi_subDir, ".EAF")
  
  if (file.exists(lowercase_subDir) || file.exists(uppercase_subDir)){
      with_eaf <- append(with_eaf, subDir)
  } else {
      missing_eaf <- append(missing_eaf, subDir)
  }
}

num_missing_eaf <- length(missing_eaf)
sprintf("You have %d audio files in your collection that are missing corresponding ELAN (.eaf) files.", num_missing_eaf)


#If you want to see the names of ALL of your audio files that are MISSING ELAN (.eaf) files, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
missing_eaf

num_with_eaf <- length(with_eaf)
sprintf("You have %d audio files in your collection that have corresponding ELAN (.eaf) files.", num_with_eaf)

#If you want to see the names of ALL of your audio files that HAVE ELAN (.eaf) files, delete the "#" in front of this next line of code:
with_eaf
```


# Export results to textfiles
This section takes all the results and writes them to text files. The `files.txt` file gives a full list of files. The `missing_export.txt` file summarizes the eaf files that have missing audio (and vice versa), while `matched_export.txt` is a list of the files that are not missing corresponding files. The `filetypes.txt` file provides a list of the filetypes in the collection (and how many of each there are).

```{r}

yaml::write_yaml(files, "files.txt")

summary_export <- list('Directories'=directories, '\nEAF names'=fnames_eaf)

missing_export <- list('\neaf files that are missing audio'=missing_audio, '\nAudio files that are issing eaf transcripts'=missing_eaf, '\neaf files that have no settings files'=missing_settings, '\neaf files that have no exported transcript (text) files'=missing_txt)

matched_export <- list('eaf files that have settings files'=with_settings, '\neaf files that have audio files'=with_audio, '\naudio files that have eaf files'=with_eaf, '\neaf files that have transcript txt files'=with_txt)

yaml::write_yaml(summary_export, "summary_export.txt")
yaml::write_yaml(matched_export, "matched_export.txt")
yaml::write_yaml(missing_export, "missing_export.txt")
write.table(tab_with_group, file="Filetypes.txt", sep="\t")

```


# Further Elan file statistics

##Load Elan functions

For this section, CheckR borrows functions written by Dale Barr (https://github.com/dalejbarr), which have been compiled into a public Github repository that can be found here: `https://github.com/dalejbarr/elan`. An accompanying piece of R code, titled "functions.R", can be downloaded from the Github repo and should be run before running the following chunks of code. Barr's code allows for further analysis of ELAN tiers and data, but CheckR is merely using surface functions of Barr's code to extract basic information about ELAN tiers for specific EAF files, as CheckR is used as a sanity check for users and depositors of collections. 

For further uses of Barr's code functions, please follow the documentation from the linked Github repository.

```{r}
# This pulls the functions directly from the github repo.
source("https://raw.github.com/dalejbarr/elan/master/R/functions.R")

#Alternatively, you may want to download them and then load them directly, in which case you can use this code:

download.file("https://raw.github.com/dalejbarr/elan/master/R/functions.R", "dalejbarr_functions.R")
source("dalejbarr_functions.R")

```


## Parse structure of Elan files

This section parses the eaf files in the collection and exports a text file with their file structure.

```{r}
setwd(fileroot)

#with_audio[[1]]

#doc <- elanTree(with_audio[1])
#tiers <- readTierList(doc)

#ann.ali <- readAnnotations(doc)

#tiers %>%
#    inner_join(ann.ali, by="TIER_ID") %>% # join tiers to ann.ali
#    select(TIER_ID) %>% # only keep the TIER_ID column
#    unique # get rid of duplicates

#tiers %>%
#    inner_join(ann.ali, by="TIER_ID") %>%
#    group_by(TIER_ID) %>%  # form groups based on TIER_ID
#    summarize(n=n()) # count how many in each group

#i <- with_audio[1]
for (i in 1:length(with_audio)){
  doc <- elanTree(with_audio[i])
  tiers <- readTierList(doc)
  ann.ali <- readAnnotations(doc)
  tiers %>%
    inner_join(ann.ali, by="TIER_ID") %>% # join tiers to ann.ali
    select(TIER_ID) %>% # only keep the TIER_ID column
    unique # get rid of duplicates

  tiers %>%
    inner_join(ann.ali, by="TIER_ID") %>%
    group_by(TIER_ID) %>%  # form groups based on TIER_ID
    summarize(n=n()) # count how many in each group

yaml::write_yaml(tiers, paste(with_audio[i], ".txt", sep=""))
 
  }

```
