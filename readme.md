This archive has scripts for working with linguistic fieldwork archival collections. It is a set of sanity checks for files. It is meant mostly for fieldworkers who already have documentation collections and want to check what is in the folders, what's missing, or what's inconsistent in file naming conventions. 

We are very happy to collaborate! And we'd like to know about features that would be useful.

To use the scripts, you need R and RStudio (both free). R can be downloaded from r-project.org (a list of mirrors is [here][https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html]). RStudio can be downloaded [here][https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/]. Clone or download this repository, open the checkR.rmd file, and follow the instructions to install the required packages and tell the checkR script which directory you want to analyse.
